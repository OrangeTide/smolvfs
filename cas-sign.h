/****************************************************************
 * What this is for
 ****************************************************************
 *
 * A ref is a mutable pointer to a root address, and whoever controls
 * it controls which tree a client materializes.  Fetching one over
 * TLS moves that trust to the serving origin, which is the wrong
 * party: a mirror, a cache, or a community server should be able to
 * carry a ref without being able to change what it means.
 *
 * A version record moves the trust anchor to the publisher.  It is a
 * fixed-size, self-addressed CAS object that names a root, carries a
 * sequence number, links to its predecessor, and is signed by the key
 * the topic is named after.  Verifying one needs no registry and no
 * connection to anybody: the name binds to the key.
 *
 * The record says nothing about transport.  It verifies the same
 * whether it arrived over HTTP, from a peer, or off a USB stick.
 *
 * Chain and monotonicity checks are a layer above this one, which
 * concerns itself with a single record.

/****************************************************************
 * Signature scheme
 ****************************************************************
 *
 * EdDSA over curve25519 with **BLAKE2b**, as implemented by
 * monocypher's crypto_eddsa_* family.
 *
 * This is deliberately *not* RFC 8032 Ed25519, which is the same
 * construction with SHA-512.  A signature here will not verify with a
 * library advertising "Ed25519", and one produced by such a library
 * will not verify here.  The choice keeps BLAKE2b as the only hash
 * primitive in the system, which smolvfs already depends on for every
 * address.  An implementation in another language wanting to
 * interoperate implements Ed25519 with BLAKE2b-512 substituted for
 * SHA-512 throughout; monocypher is the normative reference.
 *
 * The backend is selected at compile time, mirroring the codec table
 * in cas-codec.h.  Build with -DCAS_WITH_MONOCYPHER for the bundled
 * one.  An application bringing its own defines CAS_SIGN_USER when
 * building cas-sign.c:
 *
 *   #define CAS_SIGN_USER(X) X(my_sign, my_check)
 *
 * With no backend the module still parses records but cannot verify
 * them, and says so with CAS_SIGN_ENOBACKEND rather than reporting
 * success.  An absent verifier must never look like a passing one.

 * Key files
 ****************************************************************
 *
 * A secret key is local-domain data (ATOLL A3): it is never served, and
 * it does not belong in a depot, whose whole purpose is to hand objects
 * to other people.  So it lives in an ordinary file the caller names,
 * outside any depot, and the two are never mixed.
 *
 * The file holds the 32-byte seed, from which the pair is derived on
 * load.  Storing the seed rather than the expanded key keeps the file
 * small and makes it obvious there is exactly one secret in it.
 *
 * Format, two text lines so the file is greppable and identifiable:
 *
 *     smolvfs-secret-key-v1
 *     <64 hex characters>
 *
 * Permissions are enforced, not merely suggested.  Generation creates
 * the file 0600 and refuses to overwrite one that exists, and loading
 * refuses a key any group or other user can read.  A secret readable by
 * the wrong account is not a secret, and reporting that as an error the
 * moment it is noticed is cheaper than the alternative.
 *
 * Passphrase protection is deliberately absent for now: it needs a key
 * derivation function and a decision about where the passphrase comes
 * from, and a wrong answer there is worse than an honest plaintext file
 * with strict permissions.

 *  its key is being used by someone else.  It is not a validation
 *  failure to retry past; it is the one outcome that should stop a
 *  subscriber and raise an alarm.
 *
 *  EGAP is not a rejection either.  It means the caller has to decide:
 *  fetch the intermediate records and re-check, which gets full
 *  continuity, or accept the jump on the signature alone, which is
 *  sound for advancing a head but abandons the audit trail.  Hiding
